# Concept Extraction
1: `Preprocessing`
>- Extract documents(video subtitles).
>- Clean the documents : Tokenizing, Morphology Analysis & Removing stopwords.

2: `Concept Extraction`
>- Extract concpets from each document(based on their Weights).
>- Algorithm: TF-IDF(Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency)

3: `Clustering(Categorization)`
>- Create clusters(categories) based on Cosine Similarity.
>- Algorithm: Hierarchical Clustering

4: `Recommendation`
>- Extract concepts from each cluster.
>- Provide wikipedia page & related lecture information when someone wants to know about a concept.
